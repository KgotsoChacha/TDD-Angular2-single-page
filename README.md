## Installation

You will need to install the latest version of node, found [here](https://nodejs.org), run the installer and follow the instructions. You need to restart your computer before working with node. Test to check if the installation was successfull by opening your terminal, or command prompt and typing node -v. This should print out the version number. The procedure is the same for NPM, just replace node with NPM and that should print out the NPM version as well. Note that the versions do not have to be the same.
