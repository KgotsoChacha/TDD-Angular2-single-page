# Single page Angular application

This application is a single page application with sectional scrolling and follows a Test-Driven-Development approach.

## Installation

You will need to install the latest version of node, found [here](https://nodejs.org), run the installer and follow the instructions. You need to restart your computer before working with node. Test to check if the installation was successfull by opening your terminal, or command prompt and typing node -v. This should print out the version number. The procedure is the same for NPM, just replace node with NPM and that should print out the NPM version as well. Note that the versions do not have to be the same.

## Running the application

Ensure you are inside the TDD-Angular application and open the terminal from there.
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.
